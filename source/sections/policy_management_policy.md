# Policy Management Policy

C3LX implements policies and procedures to maintain compliance and integrity of data. The Security Officer and Privacy Officer are responsible for maintaining policies and procedures and assuring all C3LX workforce members, business associates, customers, and partners are adherent to all applicable policies. Previous versions of policies are retained to assure ease of finding policies at specific historic dates in time.

## Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework

* 12.c - Developing and Implementing Continuity Plans Including Information Security

## Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule

* 164.316(a) - Policies and Procedures
* 164.316(b)(1)(i) - Documentation

## Maintenance of Policies

1. All policies are stored and up to date to maintain C3LX compliance with HIPAA, HITRUST, and other relevant standards. Updates and version control are done similar to source code control using Github.
2. Policy update requests can be made by any workforce member at any time. Furthermore, all policies are reviewed annually by both the Security and Privacy Officer to assure they are accurate and up-to-date.
3. Edits and updates made by appropriate and authorized workforce members are done on their own versions, or branches. These changes are only merged back into final, or master, versions by the Privacy or Security Officer, similar to a pull request. All changes are linked to workforce personnel who made them and the Officer who accepted them.
4. All policies are made accessible to all C3LX workforce members. The current master policies are published here. (www.c3lx.com/policies)

    * Changes can be requested to policies using this form. (Google Form)
    * Once the change has been approved to a C3LX Policy we implement the policy change using **~~Salt~~**. The process for that is spelled out in the C3LX Configuration Management Policy.
    * Changes are automatically communicated to all C3LX team members through integrations between Github and Slack that log all Github policy channels to a dedicated C3LX Slack Channel.
5. All policies, and associated documentation, are retained for 6 years from the date of its creation or the date when it last was in effect, whichever is later

    1. Version history of all C3LX policies is done via Github.
    2. Backup storage of all policies is done with Box.
6. The policies and information security policies are reviewed and audited annually. Issues that come up as part of this process are reviewed by C3LX management to assure all risks and potential gaps are mitigated and/or fully addressed. The policy review form can be found here. (Google Form)
7. C3LX tracks compliance with HIPAA and publishes results here. (https://c3lx.com/policies)
