# Introduction

C3LX, Inc (“C3LX") is committed to ensuring the confidentiality, privacy, integrity, and availability of all electronic protected health information (ePHI) it receives, maintains, processes and/or transmits on behalf of its Users and Clients (“Customers”).

C3LX provides secure and compliant cloud-based software. This hosted software falls into two broad categories: 1) **Health and Wellness Applications (Apps)** and 2) **Population Health Management & Reporting (Tools)**. These Categories are cited throughout polices as Customers in each category inherit different policies, procedures, and obligations from C3LX.

As providers of disease-specific, patient-facing health and wellness software, C3LX strives to maintain compliance, proactively address information security, mitigate risk for its Customers, and assure known breaches are completely and effectively communicated in a timely manner. The following documents address core policies used by C3LX to maintain compliance and assure the proper protections of infrastructure used to store, process, and transmit ePHI for C3LX Customers.

## License

C3LX HIPAA policies have been adapted from the Catalyze, Inc. open-source HIPAA policies.

The original policies can be found, hosted by Catalyze, [here](https://github.com/catalyzeio/policies).

## Health and Wellness Applications (Apps)

Apps Customers utilize hosted software from C3LX to input and store personal health data. Customers also communicate with C3LX employed health coaches (“Coaches”) within the software. These apps are deployed into compliant containers run on systems secured and managed by Aptible, Inc (“Aptible”). Aptible does not have insight or access into application level data of Apps Customers and, as such, does not have the ability to secure or manage risk associated with application level vulnerabilities and security weaknesses. With Apps, C3LX has access to data models and manages all application level configurations and security. C3LX makes every effort to reduce the risk of unauthorized disclosure, access, and/or breach of Apps Customer data through network (firewalls, dedicated IP spaces, etc) and server settings (encryption at rest and in transit, Threatstack throughout the Platform, etc).

## Population Health Management & Reporting (Tools)

Tools are compliant services that are offered as part of the Apps. These services currently include our Health Coach Platform (Patient Monitoring and secure Messaging Service) and Friends & Family Platform (Single Patient Monitoring). With Tools, C3LX has access to data models and manages all application level configurations and security.

In the future there may be 3rd party Add-on services available as part of the C3LX Apps and Tools (“Platform”). These 3rd party, or Partner, Services will be fully reviewed by C3LX to assure they do not have a negative impact on C3LX's information security and compliance posture.

## Compliance Inheritance
C3LX signs business associate agreements (BAAs) with its 3rd party providers (“Providers”). These BAAs outline C3LX's obligations and Provider obligations, as well as liability in the case of a breach. In providing infrastructure and managing security configurations that are a part of the technology requirements that exist in HIPAA and HITRUST, as well as future compliance frameworks, C3LX does not manage any aspects of compliance for Providers.

Certain aspects of compliance cannot be inherited. Because of this, C3LX Providers, in order to achieve full compliance or HITRUST Certification, must implement certain organizational policies. These policies and aspects of compliance fall outside of the services and obligations of C3LX.
