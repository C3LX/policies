# Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, C3LX understands and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as  a business associate, C3LX is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, C3LX has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for C3LX Customers to support data retention laws.

## State Medical Record Laws

## Data Retention Policy

* Current C3LX Customers have data stored by C3LX as a part of the C3LX Platform.
* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are
    1. Customer is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.
    2. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is sent directions for how to download their data from C3LX and/or to have C3LX continue to store the data at a rate of $1/month for up to 1GB. If there is more than 1GB of data, C3LX will work with Customer to determine storage costs.
    3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from C3LX within 30 days, C3LX removes data from C3LX systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
